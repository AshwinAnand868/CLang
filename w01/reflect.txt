Reflection of Workshop1

Q-1 What have you learned in completing this workshop?
A-1 From this workshop, I have learned to use  printf function by including stdio.h library in my code. This function is used to print the output to the console. In addition, this taught me how to make directories by using a command "mkdir directory_name" and also I learned to use -Wall option, which is used to generate all warnings to console after compiling.Submitting the workshop through Putty, is also one of the things, I learned.

Q-2 Briefly describe what SSH is and how you used it in this workshop ?
A-2 SSH, also stands for Secure Shell Protocol, is a network protocol that allows to connect one or more computer to another computer or server in a secured way. This is secure because it sends data in an encrypted form and also needs password authentication and public key for the user to access or connect. Public key is a large number that is generated by program for security concerns. Basically, I used Putty (SSH application) in this workshop for connecting to matrix server, to create directories and for submission of my workshop 1 after testing.

Q-3 Briefly describe what SFTP is and how you used it in this workshop ?
A-3 If we want to be sure that our files must be transferred with full security to any computer or server then we use a file transfer protocol which is called SFTP(Secure  or SSH File Transfer Protocol). This particularly works over SSH and encrypts data in files during the process or while transeferring. I used here WinSCP, for connecting to matrix server  and to send my source files or text files, so that I can compile them later on by using SSH(Putty).
